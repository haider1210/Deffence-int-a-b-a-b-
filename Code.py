The difference between `int(op2 / op1)` and `op2 // op1` lies in how they handle the result of the division.

1. `int(op2 / op1)`: This expression performs regular division (`/`). It calculates the exact quotient of `op2` divided by `op1` and then converts the result to an integer. This conversion to an integer may involve rounding towards zero.

   ```python
   result = int(7 / 3)  # Result is 2
   ```

   In the case of a positive division result, `int(op2 / op1)` truncates towards zero, effectively discarding the decimal part.

2. `op2 // op1`: This expression performs floor division (`//`). It calculates the largest integer less than or equal to the exact quotient of `op2` divided by `op1`. This always rounds down to the nearest integer, even for negative division results.

   ```python
   result = 7 // 3  # Result is 2
   ```

   Floor division always returns an integer result that is less than or equal to the true quotient.

In summary, `int(op2 / op1)` and `op2 // op1` might give different results for negative division, as the rounding behavior differs. If the division result is positive or zero, both expressions should yield the same result.
